# CorePhysics Engine
A physics computation toolkit built for students, engineers, and researchers.

CorePhysics Engine is a Python-based tool that brings together multiple physics calculators into one clean, powerful, and easy-to-use system.  
It is designed to solve real-world physics problems across mechanics, electricity, optics, and gravitational physics — all in one unified engine.


## What the Engine can do

# 1. Motion Solver (SUVAT Module)
Solve linear motion problems using the five SUVAT equations.  
The engine intelligently handles missing variables and computes unknown motion parameters such as:
- Displacement (s)
- Initial velocity (u)
- Final velocity (v)
- Time (t)
- Acceleration (a)


# 2. Electricity & Power Module  
Compute essential electrical quantities used in circuits:
- Ohm’s Law (V = IR)
- Electric Power (P = IV)
- Energy consumption (E = Pt)
- Resistive calculations


# 3. Optics Module (Lens Calculator)
Solve fundamental optics equations:
- Thin lens formula: 1/f = 1/u + 1/v
- Magnification: m = v / u
- Identifies image type (real/virtual), orientation, and magnification scale.


# 4. Gravity & Forces Module
Calculate gravitational and force-related quantities:
- Newton’s Law of Gravitation  
- Weight and mass conversions  
- Gravitational potential energy  
- Acceleration due to gravity (g = GM/r²)


## How It Works

When the user launches the program, CorePhysics Engine provides a clean menu:

Welcome to CorePhysics Engine
Choose a module:
1. Motion Solver (SUVAT)
2. Electricity & Power
3. Optics
4. Gravity & Forces
5. Exit

Each module then guides the user through the variables needed and computes the results step-by-step with clear output formatting.


## Why I Built This Project

As a physics student, I wanted a single tool that could handle multiple physics problems without switching between different calculators or apps.  
CorePhysics Engine is what i built to be:

- Simple enough for beginners  
- Powerful enough for physics students  
- Extendable for future modules
